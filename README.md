# surface_profile_analysis

## Overview
Uses computer vision python code to analyze curvature of images.

## Features
- Extracts curvature of samples in the form of .jpg files.

## Requirements
- Update folder path
```bash
folder_path = "C:/path/to/images"  # << change for your folder with images
```
- Manually adjust color threshold based on your image
```bash
# Threshold for yellow-orange region in BGR
lower_bgr = np.array([0, 100, 150])
upper_bgr = np.array([120, 255, 255])
```

# Insallation
Install the following dependencies:
(note: this step is not required if dependencies are already installed)
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install opencv-python
pip install scipy
```
